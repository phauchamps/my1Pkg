## Introduction

`my1pkg` is my personal package. It contains one handy function that I find personally very useful!

First, install and load the package, then follow this tutorial to get used to the different functionalities of this wonderful package!
  
## Example 1 
  
If you want to get the sum of `1` and `2` just do  

```{r} 
add(1,2)
```

## Example 2 

If you want to get the sum of `1` and `2` and an accompanying plot just add the option `plot = TRUE` like this  

```{r} 
add(1,2, plot = TRUE)
```
